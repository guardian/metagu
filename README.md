# Prototype of a Guardian pseudo-AI

A pseudo-AI bot interface to the Guardian, living on Twitter as
[@metagu](https://twitter.com/metagu). You can talk to it there!

Its goal is to explore a new way to interact with and think about our
journalistic content, using dialogue in natural language. It also
shows the need for more structured representations of our content.

Note: this is alpha software released during a 2-day hackday. Be kind to it.


## Sample interactions

Here are examples of things you can ask @metagu:

* @metagu hey, do you have a review of The Peripheral?
* @metagu what do you think of the last film with george clooney?
* @metagu how is the latest Deerhunter album?
* @metagu have you got an ottolenghi recipe __
* @metagu Who is Bernie Sanders?
* @metagu what is Daesh?
